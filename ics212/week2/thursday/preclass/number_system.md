# Numeric Systems

- Decimal: base 10
- Binary: base 2
- Hexadexcimal: base 16

- Conversion
  Decimal to n-nary:
  keep dividing a the decimal by the n-nary base, the remainder is the n-nary digit, and absolute division until reaching 0.
  Binary to Hexadexcimal:
  replace each 4 set of a binary digit to the corresponding Hexadexcimal digit.

# Integer Representation

- Unsigned intgers: positive integers only
  no sign, therefore no negative sign;
  Uses the most amount of bits they can given the computer's architecture.

- Signed Integers
  Represent positive and negative integers
  MSB, leftmost bit used to indicate the sign.

- complement form.
  - one's complement
    Of a given binary number, flip the bits to obtain the complement
  - two complement
    one's complement plus 1.

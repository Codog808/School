# loops

- to repeat the execution of selected code.

* counting loops: counters to control the number of repititions
  : A loop that prints hello world 10 times.
* sentinal loops: repeats until a sentinal (or specific signal) is found.
  : a loop where a menu repeats until the user signals they are done

- pre-test: wwhere the condition is tested before running the code within it.
- post-test: where the condition is tested after running the code within it.

## while

- Could be a sentinal or a counting loop and is a pre-test loop.
- it must be updated within the loop to eventually terminate or else an infinte loop will occur.

## for

- a pre-test loop that requires an inital value, condition and an updating statement. Is a counting or iterating loop.

## do

- a post-test loop

# break

- A statement to exit switch statements or terminate loops

# continue

- statement that skips and drops the current evaluation within the loop and goes to the next pass.
- is used within an if statement to skip undesirable values iterated.

# input output and i/o redirection

- You can redirect, in unix, a file of text as input for a program or direct a file as output from a program.

* less than sign (<) for input; greater than sign (>) for output. They can be done in combination as such...
  ./program < input.txt > output.txt
